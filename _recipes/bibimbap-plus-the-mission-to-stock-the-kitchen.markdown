Yesterday is what I like to call a happy-tasty-masty-Sunday. It's kind of hard to be grumpy when you wake up to the sun shining through the blinds, soft cool sheets on your legs, and the wonderful sound of cars whooshing by outside. \[Did she say cars?\] Yes, it's LA silly, not Snow White's little cabin in the woods. No matter, it was Sunday, and that means serious food adventure business.

First stop: The Farm Mar. My affectionate term for farmer's market, it's become a Sunday classic to walk down the road for our weekly dose of local, and ideally organic, fruits and veggies. Sometimes if I'm good, we get a treat like fresh-squeezed lemonade or crusty artisan bread. But yesterday, we were on a mission: stock the kitchen.

Instead of our local Larchmont Farm Mar, we took a trip a little farther to the bigger, mama-sized market in Hollywood. While Chris was busy checking things off the list and filling our bags with curly kale, rooty carrots, pink ladies \+ fujis, I was off with a little toothpick in hand, tasting the pitted fruits each vendor had to sample. They were offering, so I might as well! I had to do thorough research... In all seriousness, the next time you go to your farm mar you better grab that peach on a toothpick or accept the mini dixie cup filled with fresh pomegranate juice cause sampling is just about the best thing that's ever invented! Just ask Costco members...

As we skipped away with our bags full of produce, we stopped by Trader's for some special items. Chris seems to be enchanted by their plum tomatoes and thinks they're a gift from the food gods. They taste like regular crushed tomatoes to me, but they're tasty and cheap so I say yes! I may or may not have gotten another sample there. Gave me the idea to make veggie tempura soon \[possible future blog post? I think yes\]

Last but not least, we ventured to HK. Han Kook Market is your typical Asian supermarket with an aisle dedicated to miso and seaweed, cheap and fresh produce, and all those delectable specialty prepared foods you can't find at your typical grocery store. We got our bundle of shiitakes, rice noodle wrappers, ban chan, and garlic. Plus we ran over to Paris Baguette to get a French cream loaf so I can try my hand at bread pudding this week.

Here's what we ended up making for dinner after our foodventure-filled day! It's called bibimbap, and for those of you that haven't had it, heard of it, don't even know if you want to try and pronounce it, it's not that scary. In fact, it's pretty frickin delicious. Think of it as a Korean rice bowl, but served in a fiery hot pot that makes your rice sizzle and a red pepper sauce (gochujang) that's kind of like Korean ketchup, only like a thousand times better and spicier and more flavorful than ketchup.

Anywhoo, you can make a whole bunch of varieties to bibimbap and don't need too many special ingredients or equipment. Since I'm vegetarian, I didn't add meat, but I'm convinced it doesn't need it! The mushrooms and egg give it enough body to fill you up. If you don't have the veggies I listed, feel free to choose ones you like and modify as you wish. I'm a firm believer in cooking what you like, so grab what makes you happy and see if it works! Scroll down past the pics for recipe!
